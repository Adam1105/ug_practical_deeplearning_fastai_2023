# Practical Deep Learning Course at the University of Gdansk
based on the fastAI Practical Deep Learning course (https://course.fast.ai) 

## Welcome!
Welcome to the Git repository for the Practical Deep Learning course at the University of Gdansk! This repository serves as a centralized hub for hosting and sharing course materials, including Jupyter notebooks and related resources. The course is based on the fastAI Practical Deep Learning course (https://course.fast.ai) and has been adjusted to work smoothly within the Amazon SageMaker-Lab environment, tailored to suit the pace of our lectures.

## Repository Structure:

* Notebooks: This directory contains Jupyter notebooks that cover the course topics and practical exercises. Each notebook is self-contained, providing detailed explanations, code examples, and tasks for hands-on practice. The notebooks are organized based on the lecture topics and follow the course curriculum.

* Resources: This directory holds additional resources that complement the course content. It includes presentation slides, utility scripts, and any other relevant materials required for the exercises and assignments.

* References: In this directory, you will find reference materials, such as research papers, articles, and links to external resources, that provide further insights and background information on deep learning concepts covered in the course. These references can be valuable for enhancing your understanding and exploring specific topics in more depth.

* Assignments: This directory contains assignments or projects that will be given during the course. Each assignment will have its own dedicated folder with instructions, starter code, and any necessary datasets. You can submit your completed assignments by creating a separate branch/fork from the repository.

## Usage:

To access the course materials, you can clone this repository to your local machine using Git or download specific files as needed. The Jupyter notebooks can be opened and executed in the Amazon SageMaker-Lab environment or any local Jupyter environment with the required dependencies installed.

Please note that the repository will be regularly updated with new materials, including lecture slides, code updates, and additional resources. It is recommended to pull the latest changes frequently to stay up to date with the course content.

## Contributions:

While the repository primarily serves as a distribution channel for course materials, contributions from students are welcome. If you discover any issues, have suggestions for improvements, or want to contribute relevant resources, you can submit a pull request or reach out to the course instructors for further discussion.

We hope you find this Git repository helpful and that it enhances your learning experience in the Practical Deep Learning course at the University of Gdansk. Happy coding and deep learning exploration!
